## Various scripts for a combined MythTV/XBMC box to make it all run smoothly...

### checkshutdown
This script is based on the checkshutdown script found here:
https://github.com/sdt/mythtv-scripts

I have modified it slightly so it works when XBMC is used as a MythTV frontend.  It's called from this xbmc addon to manage powersaving, wake for record etc:https://github.com/ta264/service.mythtv.powersave

### powerbtn.sh
Rename existing /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh to /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh.orig.  This version calls checkshutdown when the power button is pressed and if it likes the answer it will shutdown, otherwise it will do nothing.

### 70_mythbackend
This is a script for power manangement (sudo apt-get install pm-utils) to workaround dodgy dvb drivers which break on suspend.  Place in /etc/pm/sleep.d to shut down mythbackend when sleeping.  Add SUSPEND_MODULES="cx23885" to /etc/pm/config.d/config to unload the dvb modules on sleep which fixes the problem.

### advancedsettings.xml
lives in ~/.xbmc/userdata.  Currently just has settings for cpu and gpu temperature.
