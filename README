## Various scripts for a combined MythTV/XBMC box to make it all run smoothly...

### checkshutdown
This script is based on the checkshutdown script found here:
https://github.com/sdt/mythtv-scripts

I have modified it slightly so it works when XBMC is used as a MythTV frontend.  It's called from this xbmc addon to manage powersaving, wake for record etc:https://github.com/ta264/service.mythtv.powersave

### powerbtn.sh
Rename existing /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh to /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh.orig.  This version checks mythshutdownstatus and if it likes the answer it will shutdown, otherwise it will do nothing.
